[GitHub Actions run #55](https://github.com/DelonCarnales/fixflow/actions/runs/39833487378) passed on October 22, 2026:
- 8 frontend mock service tests
- 14 browser smoke checks against the frontend, FastAPI, and SQLite

## Workflow
Every issue should have Goal, Description, Acceptance criteria, Out of scope, and Constraints. PM grooms the scope. The engineer implements without closing it. QA checks acceptance criteria, runs tests, posts a PASS/FAIL comment, and closes only after PASS.
